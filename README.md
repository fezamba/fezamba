**`Software Developer`**

Developer and Information Systems undergraduate at UNIRIO, focused on backend development with Java and Spring. I design and build scalable, well-structured APIs and services, connecting business logic, databases, and integrations in enterprise environments.

Experience with backend architecture, RESTful APIs, automation, and agile methodologies, primarily focused on Java-based solutions. Hands-on work with enterprise integrations, including SAP environments with ABAP development, integrations between SAP and Java services, and frontend applications using Angular.

Currently deepening expertise in the Spring ecosystem, cloud-ready architectures, distributed systems, and SAP backend development with ABAP, while maintaining Angular and Fiori as complementary frontend skills, aiming to grow into a backend specialist for high-impact enterprise platforms.
